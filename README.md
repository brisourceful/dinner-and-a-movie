## Code Fellows 301 Final Project: Dinner And A Movie

[Dinner And A Movie on Heroku](http://dinner-and-a-movie.herokuapp.com/)

Have you ever wanted to seamlessly facilitate the classic date night scenario of dinner and a movie? Have you ever arrived at the theater with extra time and an extra appetite but are unfamiliar with the area and where to eat? 

Dinner And A Movie will show you nearby theaters and corresponding restaurants based on a user input address. It will also connect you with real reviews and links to restaurant menus.

Our search results provide users with:
- Theater address
- Theater information and reviews
- Surrounding restaurants within a half-mile radius
- Restaurant reviews, information, and links to menus
